# Ebrahim OS

An experimental operating system built as a learning project.

## Why?
Started as a joke, turned into a deep dive into:
- bootloaders (GRUB)
- freestanding kernels
- VGA text mode
- interrupts
- C & Assembly

## Status
Early-stage / educational project.

## Run
make clean && make iso && make run
